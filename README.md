# Udemy Superlearner


This ([extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)) adds more granular playback speed options for videos on Udemy so you have it easier at becoming a superlearner.

By playing courses at 1.1x speed, you will already save about 10% of playback time, that means that you will be able to finish a 20-hour course in 18 hours, and by gradually progressing by incrementing playback speed as you get used to it, when you reach 1.7x speed you will be able to finish the same 20-hour course in less than 12 hours.

It also adds a 0.9x version for the videos where you feel the instructor is going too fast. Anything lower than 0.9x generally results in an uncomfortable sloth-like audio.
